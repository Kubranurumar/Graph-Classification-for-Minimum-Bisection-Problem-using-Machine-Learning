# Graph-Classification-for-Minimum-Bisection-Problem-using-Machine-Learning
The minimum bisection problem (MBP) is a well-known NP-hard problem, which is intended to divide a given graph into two disjoint subsets while minimizing the number of edges that cross between these two subsets.

In this project, we tried to achieve finding a model that performs best for Minimum Bisection Problem.
